## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.
Describe at least:

<br>

<br>

***How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?***

*Marcelo Clark*

* These skills will lead to strong cohesion between myself and my team mates. I will be on time, helpful, and determined to get my part of the project done so that we can have the best project possible. Listening will let me take consideration from other team mates and implement any solutions that any one comes up with.

*Dustin Haggett*

* Show up each day and contribute in the most helpful and efficient way possible

*Robert Gillespie*

* Showing up everyday and putting my best effort on my portion of the presentation while working with my team.

*Jonathan McMullin*

* Try to identify the most efficient processes, maintain open communication

*Raphael Chookagian*

* I have experience using many of the programs we will be using for the presentation and task completions.

<br>

***In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?***

*Marcelo Clark*

* I would like to improve my networking and technical skills.

*Dustin Haggett*

*Robert Gillespie*

*Jonathan McMullin*

*Raphael Chookagian*

<br>

***Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?***

*Marcelo Clark*

* I plan on communicating with my teammates so that everyone is on track as to what they are doing. We will use the slack messenger app and remo to hash out any problems or come up with solutions.

*Dustin Hagget*

* Dividing up all of the tasks for the week and get clear on deadlines and tasks for each day individually and as a team

*Robert Gillespie*

* Ask my teammates what is needed from me, ask if my teammates need any assistance, set a goal of what I want to get done each day and work until that goal is complete each day.

*Jonathan McMullin*

* Make sure everyone understands what we needs to be done during the morning synch meeting, keep Trello updated with progress, and be available to work through a problem collaboratively

*Raphael Chookagian*

* I have found that it is best if everyone works together from the beginning and keeps pace throughout the project. Stand-ups each morning should set the tone and pace for the day with clear goals and tasks to complete for the day.

<br>

*NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.*

<br>

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
Describe at least:

***What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?***

* Group discussion and democratic resolution. If discussion doesn’t resolve the issue, the majority vote will rule.

***What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?***

* Discuss as a group and, if necessary, contact the instructor.

***How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?***

* Assign tasks that work to people’s strengths and offer collaborative support as needed.

***How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?***

* We will all know if someone isn’t pulling their weight and calmly confront them and give them a chance to change. If unsuccessful, we will escalate to the instructor.

***How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?***

* If we are unable to settle conflict through dialogue or by taking a vote on an issue, we can escalate the conflict to the instructor.

<br>

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
Describe at least:

***What hours will you be available to communicate?***

* 9am - 6pm (M-F) available via Slack.  Case-by-Case

***What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, Discord …)?***

*Slack , REMO, Zoom, Trello

***How often will you take breaks?***

* Each member will be trusted to schedule their breaks as they need. We will all mostly be available during the team hours listed above, while some may be working earlier or later, based on time zone. If someone needs to be away for an extended period of time (such as more than an hour) they will notify the team either verbally on Remo, or through a Slack message.

***What is your plan if you start to fall behind?***

* Each team member is expected to inform the others of their status so we can cover down if needed.

***How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?***

* Slack

***What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?***

* Ensure everyone is in the room during key discussions, or is given a summary of the reasoning behind a decision. Encourage turn-taking during discussion and ensure everyone speaks up during morning stand-up

***How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?***

* Be mindful of the psychological safety of group members. Encourage turn-taking during a group discussion, make sure everyone speaks up during the morning stand-up meeting

<br>

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

*NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, building or making changes to the project infrastructure on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.*

Describe at least:

***How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?***

* Compare the assigned project against the “Grading” Section outlined in Project: Prep #2 and create actionable tasks, assign tasks based on team member preference/desire to develop skills/strengths

***What project management tool will be used?***

* Trello Workplace Board

<br>

## Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for scripting tasks.
Describe at least:

***What components of your project will be recorded in a Google Doc?***

* Prep Documents
* SOPs
* Documentation

***What components of your project will live on GitHub?***

* Documentation, Presentations and Scripts repositories

***How will you structure the GitHub organization and the repos inside of it?***

* We will have each section organized with its own Repo and folder/directory tree.

***How will you share the organization and the repositories with your teammates?***

* All members will be added to the Organization as Admins/Full control.

***What is your Git flow? How will you commit your work to GitHub?***

* We will have a “merge party” during standups in the morning and will plan for another towards the end of day.

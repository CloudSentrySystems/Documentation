**Compliance Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to establish and enforce compliance with best practices and security measures for the management of Identity and Access Management (IAM), server hardening, data protection, SIEM/log aggregation systems, and cloud monitoring within the AWS environment.

**Scope:**
This SOP applies to all team members and administrators responsible for managing and maintaining the AWS infrastructure and services within the organization.

**Responsibility:**
- The IT Security Team is responsible for overseeing and enforcing compliance with IAM best practices, server hardening, and data protection measures.
- The Cloud Operations Team is responsible for implementing and configuring the SIEM/log aggregation system and cloud monitoring solutions.
- The DevOps Team is responsible for deploying and maintaining Sysmon on relevant systems and implementing the attack simulation using Python script.

**Procedure:**

**1. IAM Best Practices:**
- The root account should follow AWS best practices for IAM management, including enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), using strong passwords, and limiting access to essential personnel only.
- IAM policies should be created and assigned to all team members based on the principle of least privilege, granting access only to resources necessary for their roles.

**2. Server Hardening and Data Protection:**
- A CIS-compliant Windows Server Domain Controller (DC) will be hosted on a private subnet of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) accessible only through VPN tunneling.
- Data at rest on Windows Server DC and the Linux Data Server containing PII and PCI data should be encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
- Data in transit between servers and clients should be encrypted using SSL/TLS.

**3. Sysmon and Security-Relvant System Logs:**
- The Sysmon tool will be deployed on Windows Server DC to generate security-relevant system logs, which will be forwarded to AWS CloudWatch Logs for real-time monitoring and analysis.

**4. SIEM / Log Aggregation System:**
- A SIEM/log aggregation system will be implemented using Splunk, CloudWatch, or Elastic Stack to ingest event logs in real-time from key assets, including EC2 instances.
- The SIEM system will be configured to trigger alerts for potential security incidents and anomalies, providing timely detection and response.

**5. Attack TTP Simulation:**
- The DevOps Team will develop a Python script using a new library to simulate an attack, incorporating relevant attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- The simulated attack will trigger events that will be ingested and detected by the SIEM solution, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying security threats.

**6. Cloud Monitoring:**
- VPC Flow Logs will be enabled to capture traffic within the VPC, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
- Additional automation using AWS Lambda will be implemented to analyze the captured VPC Flow Logs and detect potential malicious activities.

**7. Monitoring for Threat Activity:**
- The Cloud Operations Team will continuously monitor the AWS environment for potential threats, security issues, and unauthorized access attempts.
- Security logs for failed SSH attempts on EC2 instances will be monitored to identify potential brute-force attacks.
